# Ancient-Battles-Simulator
Strategy game with both singleplayer and muliplayer.

Something like TABS. I used pygame library for all this game and socket library. There are singleplayer and multiplayer. 
There is also redactor which serves the purpose to create your own levels. There are 37 levels in campaign. To create 
your own level, go to redactor, place some red units, press R and copy that stuff that console gave to you. After that, 
create .txt file in "levels" folder, for example, 38.txt, paste text inside and save. Further instutions and game tips 
will be on gamejolt's game page. As usual, have fun playing.
